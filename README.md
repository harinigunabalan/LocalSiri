Opportunistic Sensing Android App that Localizes users based on GPS data and uses the Context to help newbies in an area with their queries by providing a Location based chat Forum.

### Motto ###

* Design and implementation of a context aware opportunistic sensing system
* Design tasking mechanisms that trigger data collection depending on the user‘s context
* Employs built-in sensors in smart-phones to collect data automatically
* Services from IBM Bluemix cloud platform as the back-end server is used for tasks dissemination, data aggregation and visualization

### Features and Utilities:
* Use the app to post Queries about a new place, he has just now moved into and get information from Real people around you
* Server intelligently identifies the potential users in Proximity and post your questions to them as a Notification
* Use it as Forum for Location based discussions
* Use it in case of Emergency situations to Notify need for help (Ex. Blood donation needed)
